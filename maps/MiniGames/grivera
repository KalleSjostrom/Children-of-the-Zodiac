text Drip, drip, drip...
text The three drops echoes in unison with my knocks down the dark
text vast hall as the drops hits the cold ground at my feet. 
text It's so dark, are my eyes failing?

text My legs suddenly crumbled under me. I'm falling. 
text It feels as if I'm falling forever. 
text Falling down into an endless abyss.

text Luckily I came to after a while, lying on the cold ground.
text I slowly opened my weary eyes, looking around the pitch-black
text hall and I feel a rush of adrenaline as I turn my head to
text the right. There, as an angelic gift, I see a clear bright light.

text Strength fills my body once again and I start walking towards
text the light, almost running only to soon realized my mistake. 
text It was only a crack in the wall, gaping like an ominous
text smile at my misery.

text I turn to the left, following the wall. The room feels colder here.
text A stronger breeze is emanating from where I'm heading.
text I can hear the wind howling in the dark. I remember this place.
text This is another crack! I'm certain of it.

text I turn away from the crack, and soon the air gets warmer. This was
text going to be my greatest achievement. I was going to exterminate
text the demon and get the holy stone. I have failed.
text Death is crawling in my, shadow and shame will forever burden
text my soul. I could feel Death, I could hear Death.
text I could even smell Death.

text The smell intensified into a strong foul stench that bores through

text It feels as if I'm going in circles, I feel as if I'm going in the
text direction from where I started.

text There is little time left. I feel faint from blood loss and my strength
text is seeping out of my heart. To my right I can see an opening in the
text wall. I force myself there as a last desperate attempt to find an exit.
text It blackened before my eyes as I stand staring at the dead end. 
text I now knew that all hope was lost.

text This is my last words. 
text I left this story here as a warning for those how try to follow in
text my footsteps. Turn back now, before it is too late. The demon will
text ravish all who enters the unholy realm.
