text The thirteen great entities gathered their forces,
text creating majestic mountains and vast fields.
text The great ones filled the seas with cold blue water,
text where life could flourish and prosper.
text All were pleased when they saw the Tenjins

text Therefore he left, making the great ones twelve in number.

text When we are gone, only the wind will know of it.
